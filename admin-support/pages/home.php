  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  
  <p>This section of this site contains information on the configuration of the site as well as any custom functionality that users and developers of the site may need to know.</p>

  <h2>Comments Are Disabled</h2>

  <p>Due to the fact that commenting on posts was not planned to be included on the site, all comment- and discussion-related functionality was removed from the site. To restore this functionality, follow these instructions:</p>
  
  <p>Remove the following line from the <strong>functions.php</strong> file:</p>

  <code>
    include( 'inc/remove-comments.php' );
  </code>

  <p>Once this line is removed, comment-related navigation will be returned to the admin and posts will have the ability to allow comments on a post-by-post basis.</p>
